      "Text": "We agree on that, my point is that C++ does it via libraries, Rust does it by hiding unsafe blocks behind interfaces (aka libraries).<p>Time will tell which approach is ultimately superior (if either one of them is actually better), but until the it isn&#x27;t clear that the Rust approach is statistically better than the C++ approach.<p>Ultimately the advantage Rust has is the ability to possibly provide better 3rd party tooling that will enable developers to make the right decisions more often than C++ does.  Consider a tool that runs on code checkin that spits out a report of all sites where code that manipulates state that could affect an unsafe block was changed&#x2F;written so that developers could then have a very focused peer review of the code to ensure the safe code doesn&#x27;t put the state in such a spot that it causes problems.<p>I think in this way Rust may eventually be shown to be better than C++, but then again, maybe not.",

By rephrasing everything from &#x27;X is wrong because ...&#x27; to an issue of the right transgressed you&#x27;re entirely sidestepping the issue of victimless crimes. Second, they&#x27;re by nature proportional.<p>&gt; only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do<p>Right, a collective <i>is</i> the sum of its members so it has their rights and no more.<p>This firmly roots all power in the individual. It&#x27;s semantically incorrect to write a libertarian law allowing actions that people themselves don&#x27;t have the right to perform. Again, sidestepping entirely the tyranny of the majority.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s a far better base to start from.",
