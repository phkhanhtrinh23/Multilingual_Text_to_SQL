Also, the app store itself can make it difficult to find your app and your ratings are reset after every update.<p>The update cycle for iOS can create a kind of hamster wheel of constant &quot;upgrades&quot; that break even year old apps but mainly introduce features that have been as much about Apple&#x27;s business needs or supporting their aesthetic as making the platform better for devs or (often) users.<p>The contrast for Android is the tech is often less mature, support is scattered across many different handsets, you can never be sure users have upgraded to a recent version of the OS, and the percentage of users paying for apps is lower.",
