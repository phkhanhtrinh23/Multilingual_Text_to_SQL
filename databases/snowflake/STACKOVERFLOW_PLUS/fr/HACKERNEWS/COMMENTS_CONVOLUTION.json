Consider a tool that runs on code checkin that spits out a report of all sites where code that manipulates state that could affect an unsafe block was changed&#x2F;written so that developers could then have a very focused peer review of the code to ensure the safe code doesn&#x27;t put the state in such a spot that it causes problems.<p>I think in this way Rust may eventually be shown to be better than C++, but then again, maybe not.",
