The irony that this apparent cultural misunderstanding has caused jigneshg&#x27;s karma  to plummet gives me no end of mirth, but the clearly anglophile Western (and perhaps white male) reaction to jigneshg&#x27;s statement is no more accurate for it. There&#x27;s plenty of self-righteous indignation to go around this holiday season, so maybe a little forgiveness is in order, after examining the situation?",
