His luck could be said to be the merit of his ancestors.",

Even his examples where people show bias in assessment of others when they believe they are operating in a merit-based system are just examples that the system is not actually merit-based.<p>What I find disappointing is that the author does not even bother to offer even a hint at an alternative.",

Bill Gates and Microsoft is not &quot;every success story&quot;. I would be surprised to find even a hardcore believer in an ideologized meritocracy who thought that tail events like Bill Gates and Microsoft didn&#x27;t have a huge luck component.<p>Meritocracy-as-strong-just-world-hypothesis is a weak-man argument.<p>I am a believer in meritocracy. But, I note, I&#x27;m not a believer in any ideological big-M Meritocracy. Rather, I think meritocracy is the best practical way we know to organize things. In a liberal society, rather than get everybody to agree on the latent virtues they love the most, I think it makes sense to have demonstrated capability as a common ground evaluation metric. As another poster in the thread suggests, what do you want from your surgeon if not demonstrated capability?",
